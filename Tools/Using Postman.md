## When to use Postman?

* When you want to verify the API abides by the spec
* When you want to check if the API is returning the appropriate data
* To write API tests
* When something is not testable via the frontend app
* When you want to set up your test environment quickly


## HTTP request Methods:

HTTP request methods are indicating the desired action that you want to perform for a given URL.

Here are a few most used methods with whom you will meet regularly and which you need to know:

* `GET` method requests only retrieve data from a given URL and it does not have any other effect on the data.
* `POST` method is used for sending data to the server for the specified URL. 
* `PUT` method replaces all current representations of the target URL with the uploaded content.
* `DELETE` method deletes all current data of the specified URL.
* `PATCH` method is used to apply partial modifications to a URL.

You can find more about the HTTP request methods [here](https://assertible.com/blog/7-http-methods-every-web-developer-should-know-and-how-to-test-them).


## HTTP response status codes:

HTTP response status code is a response from the server of request that is displayed in a three-digit number. The first number represents the class to which it belongs, and we distinguish: 

* Informational responses (100-199)
* Successful responses (200-299)
* Redirects (300-399)
* Client errors (400-499)
* Server errors (500-599)

There are many HTTP response status codes, and here are the most important ones with whom you will meet regularly and which you need to know:

* `200` - **OK**
* `201` - **Created**
* `202` - **Accepted**
* `304` - **Not Modified**
* `400` - **Bad request**
* `401` - **Unauthorized**
* `403` - **Forbidden**
* `404` - **Not Found**
* `408` - **Request Timeout**
* `500` - **Internal error**

You can find more details on HTTP response status codes [here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status).

## How Postman works?

Postman has a really simple workflow that is repeated for every request. 
The pre-request script is executed before request execution and tests are executed after response. Code in both pre-request scripts and tests is written in JavaScript, but do not worry it is really simple and easy to understand. 

Here is a graphical representation of a single request flow:

![Postman_flow.png](/img/Postman_flow.png)

## Workspaces

*Workspaces* act as working areas that help you organize your collections and requests. One workspace could contain all the collections needed for one project. Also, it is possible to invite people to join your workspace and in that way, you can collaborate with your teammates.

### Creation of a Workspace 

1. Click **Workspaces** drop-down in the top left corner
2. Click **New Workspace**
3. Enter the name of Workspace, Summary and whether if this Workspace will be shared with your team, public or it will be personal (Only for you) 
4. Click **Create Workspace** button  

Now you created your Workspace. If you click on **Workspaces** drop-down again you will see your newly created Workspace in a list. This is a list of all of your Workspaces and from here you can edit and switch in-between them.  Also, the name of the currently chosen Workspace is displayed under the Workspaces drop-down.

##Collections

*Collections* are folders that help you organize your requests. Each collection can test different modules or related APIs. Also, having a collection is helpful if you need to monitor requests, and it is easy to export and share them. 

### Creation of a Collection

1. Click **New** button right from the name of chosen Workspace 
2. Click **Collection**.
3. Enter collection name and press enter. 

Great, collection is created and now you can add requests. 

## Creation and execution of a request 

**Note:** Further in this article [PokeAPI](https://pokeapi.co/) will be used as an example. 

Once the collection is created you need to add a request to it so let's begin. 

1. Expand your collection 
2. Click **Add a request** 
3. Enter the name of the request, let's name this request "GET Pokemons"
4. Hit enter button 
5. Set `GET` as your HTTP request method and paste the following URL `https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon/` to URL input field
	<span style="display:block; margin-top:15px; border: 1px solid black; margin-bottom:15px; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto; width:100%;">![Postman_test_request.png](/img/Postman_test_request.png)</span>
6. Execute request by clicking the **Send** button

Great, now you executed a request. As a response in a Body, you can see a list of 20 Pokemons in JSON format.

![Postman_first_20_pokemons.png](/img/Postman_first_20_pokemons.png)

## Environments and variables 

An environment is a set of key-value pairs (key represents the name of the variable).
Environments let you customize requests using variables to switch between different setups
without changing your requests. 

From the list of Pokemons that you got after executing a request, let's save Bulbasaur's URL to an environmental variable. For that, first, you need to add the environment.

### Creation of an environment

1. In the top right corner tap the *eye* icon
2. Since you do not have environments, tap the **Add** button in the *Environment* card 
3. Environment card should open as a tab. Enter the name of the environment, let's name it "Pokemons"
4. Enter "BULBASAUR_URL" as name of variable
 <span style="display:block; margin-top:15px; margin-bottom:15px; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto; width:100%;">![Postman_variable.png](/img/Postman_variable.png)</span>
5. Tap **Save** button.

 Great, now you have an empty variable in which you can add data. To switch in between environments click on the Environments drop-down and choose desired one.

 **TIP:** Name your variables (constants) with the uppercase so that is easier to separate them from the rest of the code, for example in pre-request scripts and tests.
 
### Writing a value into the variable
 
There are two ways how you can enter a value into a variable:

* You can enter a specific value to **Initial** and **Current** values input fields. Value can be everything from URL-s, strings, numbers. Usually, both **Initial** and **Current** values are the same.

	* The **Initial Value** is synced to your account via the Postman servers and shared with any collaborators who have access to the environment.

	* The **Current Value** is local to your Postman app, and is never synced to your account or shared with your teamâ€”unless you choose to persist it.

* Or you can save a value from response to a variable. 

 1. Open "GET Pokemons" request.
 2. Switch to **Tests** tab inside this request.
 3. Add following line of code in **Tests** tab:
  <span style="display:block; margin-top:15px; margin-bottom:15px; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto; width:100%;">![Postman_variable_code.png](/img/Postman_variable_code.png)</span>
 4. Execute request by clicking **Send** button.

 This line of code will save in variable "BULBASAUR_URL" whatever is the value of `data.results[0].url` key, in this case, Bulbasaur's URL. If you now open "Pokemons" environment you will see that variable contains Bulbasaur's URL. 


### Using variables

Using variables you avoid copy-paste of URL and the good thing is that variables can be used as many times as you need. 

To use a variable you need to enter the name of the variable in between double curly braces. It should look like this: `{{VARIABLE}}`. This way Postman will read and use a value from a variable. Or you can use a combination of variable and URL like this: `{{VARIABLE}}/example_url`.

Let's now use "BULBASAUR_URL" variable and value stored inside her. 

1. Create a new `GET` request but this time instead of URL enter `{{BULBASAUR_URL}}`in the URL input field  
2. Execute request. 

As a response, you will get more technical information about Bulbasaur.  

![Postman_expected_result.png](/img/Postman_expected_result.png)

* **TIP:** If there is an error, variable `{{BULBASAUR_URL}}` will be red indicating that you either misspelled its name or the variable does not exist - you did not create it and add it to your environment or you are using the wrong environment. 


## Pre-request scripts

Pre-request scripts are snippets of code that can be added to a collection, a folder, or a single request within a collection that is executed before the request is sent. The pre-request script can be super useful and the best example of it is for token creation.

### Adding pre-request script to a single request:

1. Open "GET Pokemons" request 
2. Switch to **Pre-request Script** tab

Let's take a loot at example of pre-request script for token creation:

```
 const loginRequest = {
    url: pm.environment.get{"BASE_URL"} + "auth/login",
    method: 'POST',
    header: {'Content-Type':'application/json'},
    body: {
        mode: 'raw',
        raw: JSON.stringify({"username": "admin", "password": "infinum"})
    }
};

 pm.sendRequest(loginRequest, function (err, res) {
    const loginResponse = res.json();
    pm.environment.set("TOKEN", loginResponse.token);
});
```

The first part of the code contains URL, HTTP method, header, and body with username and password that are necessary for the generation of a token. 
The second part of the code will save the generated token to the **TOKEN** variable, and we can use this variable and its value in other requests if needed. 


## Writing tests 

With Postman you can write and run tests, and they run every time you run a request. They are helpful when you are using collection runner because they give you a good preview if the request went well or failed. 

The good thing about tests is that Postman offers "Snippets" or a list of already written tests. Simply clicking on them you can add them and the best thing is that you can add as many tests as you need.

### Adding snippets:

1. Open "GET Pokemons" request
2. Switch to **Tests** tab 
3. Right from the text field locate "SNIPPETS" list
4. Find "Status code: Code is 200" snippet and clicking on it. You will see code like this:
 <span style="display:block; margin-top:15px; margin-bottom:15px; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto; width:100%;">![Postman_test_code.png](/img/Postman_test_code.png)</span> 
5. Execute request
6. In response to a request, switch to the **Test Results** tab 

Inside **Test Results** tab you should see the test "Status code is 200" marked as PASS.
 
![Postman_status200.png](/img/Postman_status200.png)

 **TIP:** Add one or two empty rows so that your tests are separated and in that way easier for reading.

### Adding more complex tests 
	
Sometimes the status of response can be 200 but the body is empty. In this case, we need to add some complexity. Let's now check if the response returned something that does not change, for example, Bulbasaur's base experience.  

1. For this test we will need to add the "BASE_EXPERIANCE" variable and set the value to 64
2. Add the following code under "Status code: Code is 200" 
		
		pm.test("Base experience", function () {
		var jsonData = pm.response.json();
		pm.expect(jsonData.base_experience.toString()).to.eql(pm.environment.get("BASE_EXPERIANCE"));
		});

3. Execute request
 
 If the status is 200 and base experience is indeed 64, tests will be marked as passed. 

![Postman_2x_tests.png](/img/Postman_2x_tests.png)

## Collection runner

The Collection Runner allows users to run sets of requests in a specified sequence against specific environments. You can also set a number of iteration, delay, save response keep variable values...

1. Click the collection that you want to run
2. After the collection tab is opened click **Run** button
2. Another tab with all requests inside the collection should open
3. Choose which requests you want to include in this run. For this example let's leave them all selected 
4. Make sure that you are using the correct environment for your collection
5. Click **Run "name of collection"** button
 
Postman will display request executions and test results in real-time.
If any test in a request script fails during the collection run, the request will be listed as failed but with proper response status. 

![Postman_test_fail.png](/img/Postman_test_fail.png)

If all tests from the list are listed as passed then the request will also be listed as passed. 

![Postman_tests_success.png](/img/Postman_tests_success.png)

**TIP:** Results can be exported by clicking on the **Export Results** button and attached to the regression test or any other type of test if it is required. 
 
## Collection monitoring

The collection monitor is a scheduled collection runner. As the mentioned value of collection run is in tests. Setting up monitor your collection run will be run as frequently as you want and if one of these tests fails, you will automatically receive an email notification.

### Setting up collection monitoring 

1. Click **Monitors** in your Workspace menu on the left side of Postman
2. Click **Create a Monitor** 
3. Add monitor name
4. Select collection that you want to monitor
5. Select environment for your collection
6. Set a time when do you want for your monitor to be executed
7. Select "Receive email notification for run failures and errors" checkbox 
8. Enter email address whey you want to get a notification

Great, now your collection will be run at the set time and you will be notified if one of your requests failed.
